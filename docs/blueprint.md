- Background color: Dark charcoal (#121212) for a modern feel, complementing the dark theme.
- Primary color: Teal (#15D4B7) for brand recognition.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00FFFF) to highlight interactive elements. The color teal, positioned between green and blue, complements a cyan accent well. Increased brightness and saturation provide clear contrast, especially in the dark theme.
